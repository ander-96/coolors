[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wagnerrosa/coolors/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wagnerrosa/coolors)

Just a webapp inspired on [lolcolors](http://lolcolors.com) of Mackenzie Child. I built it to learn rails a little bit. Everyone can log in and create new cool colors. There's an admin user who have access to the CRUD (user id 2).

You can check out the [live demo](https://coolorsonrails.herokuapp.com/).

If you wanna create an color, log in with:  
User: _contato@wagnerrosa.com_  
Pass: _coolors123_
